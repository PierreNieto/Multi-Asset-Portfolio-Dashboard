README – Multi-Asset Portfolio Module (Quant B)

Objective of the Portfolio:
The goal of this multi-asset portfolio is to analyze the correlation between macroeconomic risk and financial markets. The selected assets allow the study of:

* The relationship between interest rates, inflation, commodities, and equities
* The dynamics between risky assets (stocks, crypto) and safe-haven assets (gold)
* Diversification across US and European markets
* The impact of energy prices (Brent) on financial markets
* Portfolio effects such as volatility, correlation, and cumulative performance

Selected Assets and Justification:

AAPL – Apple (US Tech)
Represents the US technology sector. Highly sensitive to interest rate movements, making it ideal for studying rate–equity interactions and the behavior of growth stocks under macroeconomic stress.

SPY – S&P 500 ETF
The benchmark index for the US stock market. Provides a broad representation of market risk and is essential for comparing asset behavior, understanding global equity sentiment, and observing systemic risk.

ACA.PA – Crédit Agricole (Europe Finance)
A major European bank. Banks are strongly influenced by interest rates, credit conditions, and economic cycles. This asset helps analyze European financial risk and compare EU vs US market behavior.

AIR.PA – Airbus (Europe Industrial)
A cyclical industrial company. Highly sensitive to global demand, economic conditions, and energy prices. Useful for comparing industrial cyclicality with technology and financial sectors.

BZ=F – Brent Crude Oil
The global benchmark for oil prices. Important for understanding inflation pressures, energy shocks, and their effects on both equities and interest rates.

^TNX – US 10Y Bond Yield
The most monitored global macroeconomic indicator. Represents risk-free rates, monetary policy expectations, and inflation expectations. Critical for analyzing interest-rate-driven movements across all asset classes.

GC=F – Gold
A traditional safe-haven asset. Typically negatively correlated with equities during stress periods. Useful for identifying hedging behavior and studying risk-off market regimes.

A non-traditional digital asset. Sometimes correlated with equities, sometimes fully decorrelated. Adds an alternative asset class and provides insight into speculative risk and modern portfolio diversification.
