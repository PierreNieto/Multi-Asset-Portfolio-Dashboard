README – Multi-Asset Portfolio Module (Quant B)

Objective of the Portfolio:
The goal of this multi-asset portfolio is to analyze the correlation between macroeconomic risk and financial markets. The selected assets allow the study of:

* The relationship between interest rates, inflation, commodities, and equities
* The dynamics between risky assets (stocks, crypto) and safe-haven assets (gold)
* Diversification across US and European markets
* The impact of energy prices (Brent) on financial markets
* Portfolio effects such as volatility, correlation, and cumulative performance

This module is developed in parallel with the Single-Asset Analysis Module (Quant A) and merges into a unified interactive dashboard.
